# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict breast cancer using clinical and diagnostic data. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to classify medical image or numeric data for early risk detection.

## üîç Objective
To build an accurate and interpretable model that helps in predicting breast cancer likelihood, enabling early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
This project uses a breast cancer dataset sourced from a public repository. You can download the dataset from:
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

*(Only sample data or link is included; full dataset is not hosted in this repo)*

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing, normalization, and visualization
- CNN model built for classification
- Achieved over **97.85% accuracy**
- Evaluation using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC

## Results
The model demonstrated high predictive performance and robustness with real-world diagnostic data. It provides a potential foundation for decision support in clinical settings.
